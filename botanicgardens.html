<h1><center>Botanic Gardens: An Outdoor Adventure</center></h1>
<p>The Singapore Botanic Gardens was first established in 1859, as the successor of Sir Stamford Raffles' horticultural brainchild. The Gardens were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2015, making it the first botanic gardens in Asia to be given such an honour. </p>
<p>With the unique place it now occupies in our national heritage, the Gardens is hugely loved by both Singaporeans and tourists to the nation-state. Its luscious greenery and wide expanse makes it a wonderful place for outdoor adventures - be it hiking, jogging or even birdwatching! Check out some of the key highlights of the garden by<b> (1) hovering your mouse over the centre of the stars on the map and clicking on it or (2) choosing a location from the list below the map.</b></p>

<h2 id="SL">Swan Lake</h2>

<p>The Swan Lake, as its name suggests, is home to a pair of beautiful mute swans from Amsterdam. Besides the swans, there is also a large cluster of Nibong palms which were said to be planted here in 1891. The Swan Lake was constructed in 1866 and is an important source of water for the plants around the Tanglin Core in the Gardens. Visitors to the Swan Lake can be seen posing for photos with the swans in the backdrop, or simply pausing from a jog to soak in the beauty of the lake and its inhabitants.</p>
<p><i>The Swan Lake is located nearest to the Tanglin Gate.</i></p>

<h2 id="OG">VIP Orchid Garden</h2>

<p>Needless to say, orchids hold a special place in Singapore, with the hybrid orchid Vanda Miss Joaquim being our national flower. Since Singapore orchids became increasingly popular, they were used as a means of promoting stronger diplomatic ties between nations. From 1957, several State Visitors and other VIPs have been honoured with selected orchid hybrids named after them. Over 120 of these VIP orchids have been named by the Gardens and these include the <i>Dendrobium</i> Margaret Thatcher and <i>Vanda</i> William Catherine, named for Prince William and his wife Catherine. This is most certainly a place to learn about the famous figures who have visited Singapore as well as orchid hybridisation!</p>
<p><i>The VIP Orchid Garden is located nearest to the Tyersall Gate.</i></p>

<h2 id="SyL">Symphony Lake</h2>

<p>One thinks of the smooth cadences of symphonic pieces when visiting the Symphony Lake. This artificial yet magnificent lake boasts a clam-like stage that has hosted numerous bands and orchestras. Prior to the onset of COVID-19, it was a common sight to see numerous groups of both young and old lining the perimeters of the lake, listening to the soothing rhythms emanating from the brightly lit stage. Even with the momentary absence of such live performances, one can visit the lake to reminisce about the good old days or enjoy the surrounding scenery.</p>
